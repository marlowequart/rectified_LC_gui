These scripts use Finite Linear Analysis to create a 3 phase AC waveform, rectify the voltage and pass it through an LC filter.

**3phaseLC_gui.py is the main python file that creates the gui using tkinter and runs the code on the input values

**setup.py creates a .exe file of 3phaseLC_gui.py in the folder build so that the file can be run without using the cmd line

**3phaseplot.zip is the folder containing all of the files required to run the .exe file
